                            SDK-REPORTER

I. Introduction
================

The sdk-reporter generates 3 reports for mcu-sdk-2.0 repository:
  - Estimation report:
    + List of drivers which are out-of-date and should be updated to support
    new IP.
    + List of demos/examples should be ported for a new device.
  - Status report: current status of drivers/demos/examples.
  - Checklist report:
    + Provide information of socs/part numbers/boards.
    + List supported drivers/demos/examples.
These reports are used in 3 phases of NPI:
  - Estimation report: estimate what should be ported by NPI team for new socs.
  - Status report: status of drivers/demos/examples during NPI team is
    porting.
  - Checklist report: final report provides what was done by NPI team and
    this report could be an additional checklist for test team.
